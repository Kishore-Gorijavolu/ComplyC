# ComplyC — A Configurable Coding Guideline Compliance Engine for Safety-Critical C Code
### (Also a Rule-Based Static Analysis for Automotive & Embedded Systems)

ComplyC is a lightweight, configurable, standards-aware coding-guideline compliance engine designed for safety-critical embedded C projects.

It transforms natural-language coding guidelines into **executable rules** and automatically analyzes `.c` and `.h` files for deviations.

Whether you're working with automotive inverters (HVPO, HVDC), bootloaders, microcontroller firmware, or ASPICE SWE.4–SWE.6 deliverables, ComplyC enforces **consistency, safety, and traceability** from Day 1.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔍 1. Rule-Based Coding Guideline Enforcement
ComplyC parses your source code and validates it against your organization's coding-style guide, including:

- Function & variable naming conventions  
- Required module header templates  
- Commenting & documentation rules (Doxygen, inline docs)  
- Bracing & indentation style  
- Global/static variable restrictions  
- Forbidden constructs (recursion, dynamic memory, `goto`)  
- Safety-critical checks:  
  - magic numbers  
  - unguarded array writes  
  - unsafe hardware-register access  
  - missing boundary checks  

Rules are stored in **clean, editable YAML**, making it easy for teams to evolve their standards.

##  2. Detailed Non-Compliance Reports

ComplyC generates clean, audit-ready compliance reports:

- Total violations  
- Violations by severity (critical / major / minor)  
- Rule ID, title, guidance, and standard reference  
- File name, line number, highlighted snippet  
- Recommended fix for each violation  

**Supported output formats:**

- **HTML** – ideal for JIRA uploads & design reviews  
- **Markdown** – GitHub-friendly  
- **JSON** – toolchain & CI/CD integration  
- **CSV** – compliance metrics for ASPICE & ISO 26262 audits  

---

##  3. AST-Aware Static Analysis (via libclang)

Built on Clang’s AST, enabling precise structural analysis far beyond regex-based linters:

- Function declarations & definitions  
- Control structures (`if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`)  
- Typedefs, enums, macros  
- File-level metadata  
- Nested scopes, blocks, and variable lifetimes  

This ensures **accurate and deterministic rule enforcement** even in complex embedded projects.

---

##  4. Automotive & Safety Workflow Integration

ComplyC integrates naturally into:

- ASPICE V-Model  
- SWE.4 — Unit Development & Verification. (Also includes Static Analysis and Code reviews)  
- SWE.5 — Integration Testing (Unit can be alled without Mocking using Fault Injection)  
- SWE.6 — Qualification Testing (If requirements allocated to Non Functional, code review, or Documentation review as the Software test method)
- ISO 26262 Part 6 safety software workflow  
- CI/CD (GitLab, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)  

---

##  5. Configurable YAML Rule Sets

Example rule:

```yaml
- id: NAMING_001
  title: "Function names must be in lower_snake_case"
  scope: function
  pattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$"
  severity: major
  guidance: "Rename function to comply with the naming standard."
  reference: "Coding Guideline §3.2.1"
```

You can define:

- Naming conventions  
- Forbidden APIs  
- Required documentation blocks  
- Safety rules (bounds, range checks, MISRA-like constraints)  
- Formatting rules
